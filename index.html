        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Tanner Buss. I'm a Computer Science major at Brigham Young University. 
          I like puzzles and brain games. Especially nonograms which are far superior 
          than sudoku. I love music. I mostly sing but also play some piano. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't know what else I'm supposed to put here.

        <h2>Start up project: Would you Rather</h2>
        <p>
          I want to create a Would You Rather application that updates after each person 
          who uses it. That way, after someone picks a choice it can show percentage of 
          people who chose each answer. I can even put how many people have answered so 
          that there's more context behind the percentages. I want the app to only progress 
          through the questions (no returning to a previous) or at least not allow users to 
          change answers. At the end I want a free response question where people have the 
          option to add a new would you rather question.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Key features:
        </h3>
        <p>
          Answer percentages, user feedback, total answers given, maybe a progress bar for 
          how many questions left. Depending on what we learn in this class and what I need 
          to implement, I may have the number of questions set but have it randomized or allow 
          people to save their progress if there are too many questions. I'm also thinking of 
          having the answer box colors randomized. Other ideas I could potentially implement are 
          friend codes or groups so that you can see what answers were chosen by people you know.
